/* (How I would reccomend reading this thing, though there is room for
 * debate on this question - read the Neruda poem, all the comments I
 * wrote (I'm attached to a few of them), the Wallace Stevens in its
 * entirety but only once, skip the Keats except for a few lines for
 * atmosphere, the Bukowski won't take up too much of your time, read 13
 * or so birds, and don't bother with the code except for a few
 * carefully named variables)

 * BIRD
 * Pablo Neruda
 *
 * It was passed from one bird to another,
 * the whole gift of the day.
 * The day went from flute to flute,
 * went dressed in vegetation,
 * in flights which opened a tunnel
 * through which the wind would pass
 * to where birds were breaking open
 * the dense blue air -
 * and there, night came in.
 *
 * When I returned from so many journeys,
 * I stayed suspended and green
 * between sun and geography -
 * I saw how wings worked,
 * how perfumes are transmitted
 * by feathery telegraph,
 * and from above I saw the path,
 * the springs and the roof tiles,
 * the fishermen at their trades,
 * the trousers of the foam;
 * I saw it all from my green sky.
 * I had no more alphabet
 * than the swallows in their courses,
 * the tiny, shining water
 * of the small bird on fire
 * which dances out of the pollen

% Ode to a Nightingale
%    John Keats
%
% My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains
%    My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,
% Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains
%    One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk:
% 'Tis not through envy of thy happy lot
%    But being too happy in thine happiness,-
%       That though, light-winged Dryad of the trees
%          In some melodious plot
%	Of beechen green, and shadows numberless,
%	   Singest of summer in full-throated ease.
%
% O, for a drought of vintage! that hath been
%    Cool'd a long age in the deep-delved earth,
% Tasting of Flora and the country green,
%    Dance, and Provencal song, and sunburnt mirth!
% O for a beaker full of the warm South,
%    Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene,
%       With beaded bubbles winking at the brim,
%          And purple-stained mouth;
%    That I might drink, and leave the world unseen,
%       And with thee fade away into the forest dim:
%
% Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget
%    What thou among the leaves hast never known,
% The weariness, the fever, and the fret
%    Here, where men sit and hear each other groan;
% Where palsy shakes a few, sad, last gray hairs,
%    Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies;
%       Where but to think is to be full of sorrow
%          And leaden-eyed despairs,
%	Where Beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes,
%	  Or new Love pine at them beyond to-morrow.
%
% Away! away! for I will fly to thee,
%    Not charioted by Bacchus and his pards,
% But on the viewless wings of Poesy,
%    Though the dull brain perlexes and retards:
% Already with thee! tender is the night,
%    And haply the Queen-Moon is on her throne,
%       Cluster'd around by all her starry Fays;
%          But here there is no light,
%    Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown
%       Through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways
%
% I cannot see what flowers are at my feet,
%    Now what soft incense hangs upon the boughs,
% But, in embalmed darkness, guess each sweet
%    Wherewith the seasonable month endows
% The grass, the thicket, and the fruit-tree wild;
%    White hawthorn and the pastoral eglantine;
%       Fast fading violets cover'd up in leaves;
%          And mid-May's eldest child,
%    The coming musk-rose, full of dewy wine,
%       THe murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves.
%
% Darkling I listen; and, for many a time
%    I have been half in love with easeful Death,
% Call'd him soft names in many a mused rhyme,
%    To take into the air my quiet breath;
%       Now more then ever seems it rich to die,
%    To cease upon the midnight with no pain,
%       While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad
%          In such an ecstasy!
%    Still wouldst thou sing, and I have ears in vain-
%       To thy high requiem become a sod.
%
% Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird!
%    No hungry generations thread thee down;
% The voice I hear this passing night was heard
%    In ancient days by emperor and clown:
% Perhaps the self-same song that found a path
%    Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home,
%       She stood in tears amid the alien corn;
%          The same that oft-times hath at intervels.
%
%
%    Charm'd magic casements, opening on the foam
%       Of perilous seas in faery lands forlorn.
%
% Forlorn! the very word is like a bell
%    To toll me back from thee to my sole self!
% Adieu! the fancy cannot cheat so well
%    As she is fam'd to do, deceiving elf.
% Adieu! adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades
%    Past the near meadows, over the still stream,
%       Up the hill-side; and now 'tis buried deep
%          In the next valley-glades:
%    Was it a vision, or a waking dream?
%       Fled is that music:-Do I wake or sleep?

% The sound of beak on wood,
% clear air, the sun-hot dirt;
% quick clicks frantic as footsteps.
%
% Elsewhere a chirping,
% as microwaves or cellphones do.

/*
 * THIRTEEN WAYS OF LOOKING AT A BLACKBIRD
 * Wallace Stevens
 *
 * I
 * Among twenty snowy mountains,
 * The only moving thing
 * Was the eye of the blackbird.
 *
 * II
 * I was of three minds,
 * Like a tree
 * In which there are three blackbirds
 *
 * III
 * The blackbird whirled in the autumn winds.
 * It was a small part of the pantomime.
 *
 * IV
 * A man and a woman
 * Are one.
 * A man and a woman and a blackbird
 * Are one.
 *
 * V
 * I do not know which to prefer,
 * The beauty of inflections
 * Or the beauty of innuendoes,
 * The blackbird whistling
 * Or just after.
 *
 * VI
 * Icicles filled the long window
 * With barbaric glass.
 * The shadow of the blackbird
 * Crossed it, to and fro.
 * The mood
 * Traced in the shadow
 * An indecipherable cause.
 *
 * VII
 * O think men of Haddam,
 * Why do you imagine golden birds?
 * Do you not see how the blackbird
 * Walks around the feet
 * Of the women about you
 *
 * VIII
 * I know noble accents
 * And lucid, inescapable rhythms;
 * But I know, too,
 * That the blackbird is involved
 * In what I know.
 *
 * IX
 * When the blackbird flew out of sight,
 * It marked the edge
 * Of one of many circles.
 *
 * X
 * At the sight of blackbirds
 * Flying in green light,
 * Even the bawds of euphony
 * Would cry out sharply.
 *
 * XI
 * He rode over Connecticut
 * In a glass coach.
 * Once, a fear pierced him,
 * In that he mistook
 * The shadow of his equipage
 * For blackbirds.
 *
 * XII
 * The river is moving.
 * The blackbird must be flying.
 *
 * XIII
 * It was evening all afternoon.
 * It was snowing
 * And it was going to snow.
 * The blackbird sat
 * In the cedar-limbs.
